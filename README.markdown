## Ultimate QTc/QTp calculator
**EP QTc** is an iOS app that simultaneously calculates QTc (corrected QT) and QTp (predicted QT) intervals using many different published formulas.  Detailed information on each formula is given and the results can be graphed and imported into text editors or spreadsheets.  The app uses the [QTc framework](https://github.com/mannd/QTc).  For more background see [Hacking the QTc](https://www.epstudiossoftware.com/hacking-the-qtc/).

## Acknowledgments
Thanks to Marian Stiehler for help in acquiring the original literature that forms the basis of these QTc and QTp formulas.

Thanks to Dr. Simon Rabkin at the University of British Columbia for corresponding with me regarding the QT interval, and for his and his team's fine work on the [nomenclature and categorization](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4478566/) of the numerous QT formulas which formed a basis and inspiration for this app.  I also thank the multitude of investigators who over the years have attacked the problematic QT interval, using math in an attempt to flatten nature's heart rate versus repolarization curve.

This app uses [SigmaSwiftStatistics](https://github.com/evgenyneu/SigmaSwiftStatistics) for statistical analysis of the QT formulas.  This framework is copyright (c) 2015 Evgenii Neumerzhitckii and is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/evgenyneu/SigmaSwiftStatistics/blob/master/LICENSE).

The app also uses the [Charts](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts) framework for graphing.  This framework is copyright 2016 Daniel Cohen Gindi & Philipp Jahoda, and is licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html). 

The app uses [Validator]([https://github.com/adamwaite/Validator) which has an unrestricted license.
